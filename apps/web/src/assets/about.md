# About this blog

Hello and welcome to my blog!

My name is Arnaud, I am an aspiring Full-stack developer.
I previously worked as a gameplay developer for 7 years.
During that time I worked on several games that where published on console and PC.

I decided to change career to explore another side of software engineering and web development was a field I was curious to learn more about.

After a few months of following the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) roadmap, I made this blog to use as a portfolio piece to show my skills as a Full-stack developer.

This blog is composed of :

- A RESTful API, made with Spring boot, using a Postgres database. The API is a reimplementation of my already existing [Express implementation](https://github.com/arnaudSanchez1816/blog-api)
- A client made with React, styling was done using HeroUI and Tailwind.
- A content management system made with React. Authentication is done via JWT.

Source code for this blog is available on Github.\
